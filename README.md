# Terraform SDK

## How to use this repository

The aim of this repository is to define and create a **Hashicorp Terraform** structure based on best practices.

I will investigate and annotate any nice and hidden features to work with **Terraform**.

To run any of the examples do:

```shell
terraform init -var-file="directory/secret/main-jdld.json" directory/
```
